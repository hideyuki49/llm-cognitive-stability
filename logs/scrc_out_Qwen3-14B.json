They also specified that the output must be exactly two lines, starting with 'packet:' and 'latency:' respectively. No extra lines allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to define a packet. A packet is like a small piece of data that's sent over the internet. When you send a message or load a webpage, the data is broken into packets, each with a destination address. They travel through the network and are reassembled at the destination. So, I should simplify that to something like \"a small piece of data sent over the internet.\"\n\nNext, latency. Latency is the time it takes for a packet to travel from one point to another. It's like the delay you feel when you click a link and wait for it to load. So, I can say \"the time it takes for data to travel from one place to another.\"\n\nNow, check the constraints. Make sure each line starts with the correct prefix and there are no extra lines",

An attention head is part of a transformer model, right? It helps the model focus on different parts of the input when processing information.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I'm not mixing up concepts. The attention head is one of the components in the multi-head attention mechanism. Each head looks at different aspects of the input. So, maybe I should explain that each head independently processes the input to find relevant parts, and then they combine their results. That way, the model can capture various relationships in the data.\n\nThe user wants it in two sentences and no citations. Let me check if I can simplify that. First sentence: an attention head is a component in transformer models that helps the model focus on different parts of the input. Second sentence: it works by calculating how much attention to give each part, allowing the model to prioritize important information for tasks like translation or text understanding.
