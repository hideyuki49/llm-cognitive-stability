RAW_OUT: Stability in LLM outputs is often preferred because it ensures consistency and reliability in responses, which is crucial for user trust and system predictability. However, this should not always override diversity, as varied outputs can provide richer, more creative solutions and better mimic human-like unpredictability and depth of thought.

RAW_OUT: Stability should not always be preferred over diversity in LLM outputs because diversity can lead to more creative and adaptable solutions. Reason: varied outputs allow for a broader exploration of ideas and scenarios, enhancing problem-solving capabilities.
RAW_OUT: Stability in LLM outputs is often preferred over diversity because consistent results help build user trust and reliability. Predictable outcomes make it easier for users to understand and rely on the system's responses for critical tasks.

RAW_OUT: Sure, I'd be happy to help. Could you please clarify a few things for me?

1. What specific symptoms are you experiencing with your network issue? (e.g., slow speeds, inability to connect, intermittent connection)
2. Have you recently made any changes to your network setup or installed new devices?

Once I have this information, I can provide a more targeted solution.
