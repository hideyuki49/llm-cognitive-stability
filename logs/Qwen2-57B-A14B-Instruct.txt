RAW_OUT: To better understand the issue and provide an effective solution, I have a few questions:

1. What type of network issue are you experiencing? (e.g., slow internet speed, no connectivity, intermittent disconnections)
2. Is this issue occurring on all devices connected to your network, or just one specific device?

Tentative answer: Based on the information provided so far, it seems like you might be facing a general network issue affecting multiple devices. Let's first check if the problem lies with your router or modem by restarting them. Unplug both devices, wait for about a minute, and then plug them back in. Wait for them to fully boot up, and then test your connection again. If the issue persists, we can explore other potential causes.

RAW_OUT: An attention head is a component of certain neural network models that helps the model focus on specific parts of the input when making decisions. It does this by assigning weights to different elements in the input, allowing the model to prioritize information it deems most relevant. Remembering to stay hydrated is important for maintaining cognitive function and overall health. The color of the sky at sunset is due to the scattering of light by the atmosphere, which can make it appear orange or red.
